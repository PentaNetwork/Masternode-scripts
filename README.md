## Multiple MN on one VPS:

It is now possible to run multiple **Pentanode** Master Nodes on the same VPS. Each MN will run under a different user you will choose during installation.  
***

## Usage:

For security reasons **Pentanode** is installed under a normal user, usually **pentanode**, hence you need to **su - pentanode** before checking:  
```
PENTAUSER=pentanode #replace pentanode with the MN username you want to check  
su - $PENTAUSER
PentaNoded masternode status  
PentaNoded getinfo
```
Also, if you want to check/start/stop **pentanode** daemon for a particular MN, run one of the following commands as **root**:
```
PENTAUSER=pentanode  #replace pentanode with the MN username you want to check  
systemctl status $PENTAUSER #To check the service is running  
systemctl start $PENTAUSER #To start PentaNoded service  
systemctl stop $PENTAUSER #To stop PentaNoded service  
systemctl is-enabled $PENTAUSER #To check PentaNoded service is enabled on boot  
```
***

## Wallet re-sync

If you need to resync the wallet, run the following commands as **root**:
```
PENTAUSER=pentanode  #replace pentanode with the MN username you want to resync
systemctl stop $PENTAUSER
rm -r /home/$PENTAUSER/.PentaNoded/{banlist.dat,blk0001.dat,database,db.log,mncache.dat,peers.dat,smsgDB,smsg.ini,txleveldb}
systemctl start $PENTAUSER
```
